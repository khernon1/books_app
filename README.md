# books_app

I created a Rails 5 app and input dummy data in the sqlite3 database to test the below queries. I wrote out and ran the queries manually in app/models/book.rb and customer.rb so there is nothing specific to Rails about this, other than I was familiar with a Faker gem to create fake data easily.

The total numbers created are irrelevant. I wanted a large enough number to get some results and a small enough number to see the full output and query on one screen below.

Database contains:
- 20 authors
- 200 books with a randomly assigned author
- 50 customers
- 500 items in the shopping cart with a randomly assigned book and customer to each one

Below I am running the three queries from methods I created in Ruby and included more user friendly output (for the terminal, anyway).

I am very interested in the idea of joining a brand-name business in a start up situation such as this. The Business Intelligence Analyst looks to be similar to my previous roles in financial services as they have involved managing and analyzing the daily flow of data internally and externally. This included tasks such as developing advanced Excel sheets myself using VBA/SQL or working with our engineers to design and build applications so we could reliably store, understand, and present our data to technical and non-technical colleagues alike.

As my career progressed, I became passionate about learning new technologies, and saw how valuable that would be, so I left to attend the Flatiron School's immersive programming course. This grew my technical skills to include languages such as Python/Django, Ruby on Rails, and Javascript, and I am now fully equipped to learn other new languages, frameworks, technologies, etc.

Thank you for your time.
