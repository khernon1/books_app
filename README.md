# books_app

I created a Rails 5 app and input dummy data in the sqlite3 database to test the below queries. I wrote out and ran the queries manually in app/models/book.rb and customer.rb so there is nothing specific to Rails about this, other than I was familiar with a Faker gem to create fake data.

The total numbers created are irrelevant. I wanted large enough number to get results and a small enough number to see the full output and query on the video below.

Database contains:
- 20 authors
- 200 books with a randomly assigned author
- 50 customers
- 500 items in the shopping cart with a randomly assigned book and customer to each one

Below I am running the three queries from methods I created in Ruby and included more user friendly output (for the terminal, anyway).
